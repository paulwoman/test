Tips for Improving Game Running Speed^
1) When you are viewing the #firm detail window# or the #Information Center#, the game does #not# need to update the city graphics underneath the information window. (You will notice that the cars are not moving.)^
#So always open an information window if possible#. #This can save a lot of graphic processing time especially when the city is packed with buildings#.^
2) Among the various types of screens on the #Information Center#, some will require more computer processing power to display than the others. #The Farmer's Guide# is the one that requires #the least amount of processing power#.^
Hence, if you just want the game time to pass without needing to interact with any game user interfaces, you could #just open Farmer's Guide# (hotkey: F2) and the game time will advance #much faster#.^
