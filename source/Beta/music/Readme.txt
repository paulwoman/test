If you want Capitalism Lab to play custom music files that you designate instead of the original game music, 
please follow the below instructions: 

1) Delete all the original game music files in this folder (\MUSIC).  
   If you want to retain some of the original game music files and mix them with your custom music files,
   please make sure that this particular file "cap2-long01.aac" is changed to a different name, as the game
   checks the existence of this file to determine whether the game should play custom music or not. 
   
2) Copy the music files that you want the game to play to this folder (\MUSIC). 
   
   For a list of Media Formats supported for the music files, please see:
   https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/medfound/supported-media-formats-in-media-foundation
   (Capitalism Lab uses Microsoft Media Foundation to play the music.) 

3) Run the game and it will play all the music files in this folder in a random order.
