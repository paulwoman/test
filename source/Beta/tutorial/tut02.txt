~Discount megastores~ can sell anything which makes them very versatile. If, for whatever reason, the supply of a product to the store is interrupted, you can easily replace it with another product.^^On the other hand, ~a specialty store~ can only sell a specific range of products. For example, a furniture store can only sell furniture. If a supply problem occurs, you may not be able to solve it as easily because of the limited types of products that a specialty store can sell.

However, specialty stores do have advantages over general stores. A specialty stores is more attractive to customers interested in such products.^^For example, a computer store selling computers should outsell an adjacent department store selling the same product. Differences in quality, price and brand may even things out but that's for a later tutorial.
