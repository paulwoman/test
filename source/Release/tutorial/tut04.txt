Now that you know how to find suppliers, manufacture and sell products, it's time to look at ~advertising~ your products.^^Your corporation will be competing against other corporations selling the same product types.

When a consumer buys a product they consider the ~price~, the ~quality~ and the ~brand~ of the product.^^For the ~quality~, it is affected by the qualities of raw materials used and the production technology, which you have already learned in the previous tutorial.^^For the ~price~, it is very straightforward - a lower price makes a product more competitive in the market.^^A ~brand~ is a distinguishing name intended to identify and differentiate a seller's products from competitor's products.

For ~Jeans~, the concerns are: ~Price~ 27%, ~Quality~ 29% and ~Brand~ 44%.

On the other hand, for some products like ~frozen meat~, consumers are concerned less about ~brands~, and are concerned more about ~quality~ and ~prices~.^^For such products, advertising should be limited and the focus should be on optimizing your business operations to offer consumers with products of lower prices and higher quality.

If you wish to have a single brand covering every product you sell, then you should choose the ~Corporate brand strategy~.^^The ~advantage~ to this approach is that any new products you launch will instantly benefit from the recognition of the existing corporate brand.^^The ~disadvantage~ is that brand loyalty will suffer if any of your products fail to live up to consumers' quality expectations of your corporate brand.

The second strategy, ~Range brand strategy~ is similar to corporate branding but its coverage is limited to product classes.^^For example ~leather bags~ and ~leather briefcases~ fall into the ~leather goods~ product class.^^If you decided to sell ~leather briefcases~ and ~body lotions~ to accompany the ~leather bags~ you already sell, you ~leather briefcases~ would immediately inherit the brand rating of your ~leather bags~ (~same product class~) but your ~body lotions~ would not.
