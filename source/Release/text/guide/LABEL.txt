[Private Labelling Unit]

A private labeling unit converts products of other brands to your own brand by labeling the product with your own corporate insignia. If you are tired of manufacturing products yourself, you can label products of a less popular brand with your own brand. This saves you the trouble of managing production lines and lets you concentrate on marketing.^

Any products directed into the private-labeling unit are relabeled immediately. Usually linking a private labeling unit between a purchasing unit and a sale unit is the easiest way to label the products from another corporation. In this arrangement of units, the purchased goods from another company are labeled with your brand and resold as if you had produced them yourself.^
